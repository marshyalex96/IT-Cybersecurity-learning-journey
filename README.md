# IT-Cybersecurity-learning-journey
after going to school and obtained my certification. I come to a realization that the field of IT &amp; Cybersecurity world is a never ending journey as you continue to learn and gain knowledge as technology is ever evolving. i'd like to share what i have learned back then and now as i practice to hone my skills as we have to put in the effort.
I'm currently using tryhackme.com and letsdefend.io, and soon to start with cyberdefender.org to help me gain hands-ons experience and building a solid  continued fundamentals  not only Cybersecurity, but IT. Here i will display screenshot of the rooms and paths i completed and what i learned from taking these courses and gain Experience with it ( It's like leveling up and unlocking new skills and build confidence)

here so far is how many rooms I completed so far. It help me gain knowledge  focusing on Incident Response and Security Operation Center learning networking concepts, the 7 layers of OSI and what are their functioning, email phishing and how to spot spammers/scammers and use tools I.E  VirusTotal, hybrid analysis, and  to scan hashes, files, ip and domains and gain information from diffrent security vendors such as Fortinet, malwarebytes, and mcafee scanner. Mitre&Att&ck is like an cyber-encyclopedia that assist me to determine the Tactics, Techniques, and procedures that the attackers uses

next is my progress with letsdefends and the badges i obtained. on the upper right of the screen shows 91 current day streak (will change as I find myself using this training site alot and there's perks behind it such as a free 7 week vip+ which grant me access to use  sandbox environment if not i use virutal box windows or linux VM to analyze  malware files). nowadays companies are more interested if you have the experiences (transferable skills such as critcal thinking, problem solving, and communication comes a long way).
